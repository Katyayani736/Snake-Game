# Snake Game in Jupyter Notebook with Python and Pygame

 This repository contains the code for a simple Snake game implemented using Python and the Pygame library. This project was developed within a Jupyter Notebook environment, allowing for interactive development and visualization. It was inspired by GFG.

## Features:

### Gameplay:
* Control the snake to eat food and grow.

* Avoid colliding with the boundaries or itself.

* Game over condition when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.

* Basic scoring system and high score storing.
### Visuals:
* Simple and clean visual representation of the game board and game elements.

* Basic animations for snake movement and food appearance.
## Future Scope:

**This is a basic implementation of the Snake game. It can be further enhanced by adding features like:**

* Difficulty levels: Adjust the game speed and food spawn rate.

* Sound effects: Add sound effects for game events (e.g., eating food, game over).

* Improved visuals: Enhance the game's aesthetics with better graphics and animations.

*Disclaimer: This project is intended for fun and learning purposes. It may not be a fully optimized or production-ready game.*
